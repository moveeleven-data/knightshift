# Pipeline Runners

Modular orchestrator scripts for running individual pipeline stages.

### Scripts:
- `run_ingestion.py`: Runs Lichess TV game ingestion.
- `run_cleaning.py`: Executes game record validation and cleanup.
- `run_enrichment.py`: Enriches game data with user profiles.

These are useful for DAGs, cron, or manual runs.
