# ðŸ“Š KnightShift Database Schemas

This folder contains raw SQL definitions for initializing and versioning key
database tables used in the KnightShift data pipeline.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

These schema files ensure:
- Reliable, version-controlled initialization of the database
- Easy portability across local, Docker, and cloud environments
- Clear visibility into table structure and evolution over time

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `tv_channel_games.sql`  
  Defines the structure of ingested chess game data from Lichess TV,
  including PGN fields, metadata, and validation flags.

- `lichess_users.sql`  
  Defines the structure for enriched user profiles pulled from the Lichess API,
  including ratings, titles, and activity data.

## ðŸ›  Usage

These files are automatically loaded when the Postgres container is first
initialized via Docker Compose.

If changes are made to the schema, be sure to:
1. Update the SQL file in this directory
2. Add a description of the change to the changelog (`changelog.md`)
3. Rebuild the containers with `docker compose down -v && docker compose up`

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Files are processed alphabetically; use meaningful filenames or prefixes if
  load order matters.
- Non-SQL files (like `README.md`) are ignored during initialization.
